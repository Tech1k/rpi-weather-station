Originally By Uladzislau Bayouski


A Raspberry Pi based weather station that measures temperature, humidity and pressure using

the Astro Pi Sense HAT then uploads the data to a Weather Underground weather station.

Calculates dew point. Completely configurable and working asyncroniously in multi threads.

Uses stick for choosing different weather entities and visual styles.

Uses logger to log runtime issues/errors.
